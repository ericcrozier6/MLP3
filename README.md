## SVM

The jupyter notebook SVM can be run to create the SVM, get the raw
signal data from the testing/training data sets. 
Then we train the SVM with the testing data and its correct
classifications. We can then predict the list of signal data 
from the testing set, and get a list of the 1200 classifications.

To run the code you can just run every cell, and it should end 
up creating a text file with the classifications. There is also a 
jupyter notebook file that converts the text file into the csv file 
to submit.
